This menu allows you to select feature modules for your Config Emacs.

Navigate between checkboxes using <tab> and S-<tab>, or use the cursor
keys to move around. Hit <return> to toggle checkboxes, or to press the
buttons. When you're done, press the `Save' or `Cancel' buttons, or just
save the buffer (C-x C-s).

You can also use your mouse, but you must resist the urge to do this.
An Emacs Master does not use mice.
