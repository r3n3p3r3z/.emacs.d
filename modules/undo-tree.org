#+TITLE: undo-tree

Undo-tree allows me to have sane undo defaults, as well as being able to
visualize it in ascii art if needed.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package undo-tree
  :ensure t
  :init (global-undo-tree-mode t)
  :defer t
  :diminish ""
  :config
  (progn
    (define-key undo-tree-map (kbd "C-x u") 'undo-tree-visualize)
    (define-key undo-tree-map (kbd "C-/") 'undo-tree-undo)))
#+END_SRC
