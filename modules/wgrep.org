#+TITLE: wgrep

I occasionally use =rgrep= to search through code, and it can be pretty handy to
be able to refactor the name of a method or something by making the ~*grep*~
buffer writable, that's what wgrep does.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package wgrep
  :ensure t
  :init (require 'wgrep))
#+END_SRC
