#+TITLE: flycheck: Get the computer proof reading
#+AUTHOR: Aqeel Akber

* flycheck
=flycheck= is a modern drop in replacement for emacs =flymake=. It's
faster, more memory efficient, supports more languages, and has a
great project culture.

I say that this is doing proof reading because you can use linters to
provide style warnings, as well as whether your code will compile or
not.
