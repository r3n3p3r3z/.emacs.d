* org-mode

I would be lying if I said emacs was a good text editor out of the
box. It's great when you configure it, sure, but why the hell would
you bother doing that? Answer: Org mode. Look it up.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org
  :ensure t
  :bind (:map org-mode-map ("M-RET" . nil))
  :mode ("\\.org\\'" . org-mode)
  :init

(setq default-major-mode 'org-mode
      org-ellipsis "â†´"
      org-lowest-priority ?C
      org-default-priority ?B)

(setq org-list-allow-alphabetical t)

(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)

(setq org-yank-adjusted-subtrees t))

(require 'org-habit)

(add-to-list 'org-modules 'org-habit)

(setq org-modules '(org-habit
                    org-timer
                    org-expiry))

#+END_SRC
