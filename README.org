* Introduction

*Step one*

Back up your existing stuff and clone it in.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
git clone https://github.com/DynamicMetaFlow/.emacs.d.git
#+END_SRC

* The so called "modules"

Simplemacs makes no attempt to create a unified configuration wrapper
or anything like that. It's emacs configuration by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy][UNIX
Philosophy]], find the appropriate file for the package and edit it
yourself.

| File                        | Requires | Notes                    |

** The so called "activities"

I have extended the modules outline to include "activities". This is
for activity specific configuration.

| [[file:modules/activities/programming.org]] | None     | Minor modes |
